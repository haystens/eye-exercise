# Eye exercise 

The eye exercise's description was a website of two eye animations, whose pupils follow the direction of your mouse.

In order to run this exercise, load the site into your browser and move your coursor whereever on the page. Watch as the eyes follow!
For fututre improvements I plan to work on learning and expanding my knowledge furthur about topics such as this one, because visuals and style are important factors to me.
